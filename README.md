# Redirecty

Just a quick redirect setup for Netlify that 301 redirects everything towards another domain. The \_redirects file is in `public` to avoid the `readme.md` etc being pushed as well.

If you want to know more, it's probably better to a look at Netlify's [documentation on redirects](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/). It's really rather useful.
